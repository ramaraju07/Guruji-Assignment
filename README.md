I have already included the .env file so that it is easy to run the project and the postman collection is present in the postman folder.

So all you have to do is

``` npm install ```
<br>
``` npm start ```
`
<br>
So using only this user you will be able to delete the task
<br>
In the about section you can find the hosted URL and in the postman collection I have included it so you can just change the path URL to live
Basically there are two path live and local
