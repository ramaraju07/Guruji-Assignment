I have already included the .env file so that it is easy to run the project and the postman collection is present in the postman folder.

So all you have to do is

``` npm install ```
<br>
``` npm start ```

One more important thing is that the admin feature requirement was there
So only admin user is <br>
email: ``` sanjeevjha882@gmail.com ``` <br>
password: ``` 123456 ```
<br>
So using only this user you will be able to delete the task
